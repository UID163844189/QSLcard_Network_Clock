# Network Clock

For now, this code is for my QSL Card (PCBA Version). 

Contains a MAX7219 and 2 segment number led; one of them is the normal and the right one is clock version which have a flashing ":". 

The left led displays date, the right one displays time. 

Code forked from [flyAkari](https://github.com/flyAkari/ESP8266_Network_Clock). 

You may need to rename the folder according to Arduino complier.
